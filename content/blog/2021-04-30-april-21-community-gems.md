Each month we go through our Discord messages to pull out some of the best
questions from our community. AKA: Community Gems. üíé This month we'd like to
thank asraniel, Julian, mattlbeck, Ahti, **\_**, yikeqicn, lexzen, EdAb,
FreshLettuce for inspiring this month's gems!

As always, [join us in Discord](https://discord.com/invite/dvwXA2N) to get all
your DVC and CML questions answered!

## DVC

### [Can directories and subdirectories be created on OwnCloud with a WebDav remote when I run dvc push if they don't already exist?](https://discord.com/channels/485586884165107732/485596304961962003/831472645508694046)

This likely means that there is an issue with either the credentials or
permissions set up in WebDav. Make sure that you are using the correct protocol
and provide a username and/or token or password.

If you use webdavs for your URL and use the `ask_password` parameter for your
config, this should clear up the issue.

### [What procedures would I use if I needed to remove unwanted or outdated experiments and corresponding data in the cache?](https://discord.com/channels/485586884165107732/485596304961962003/831127462544146482)

You can use `dvc exp gc` with corresponding flags to delete the experiments
themselves and there are a number of other flags that can be used with
`dvc exp gc` depending on your needs.

Alternatively, you can remove branches that are no longer required using
`dvc exp remove`, then run `dvc gc --all-branches --all-tags`. DVC will then go
through each branch and tag revisions; will keep them, and will purge the rest.

Note that `--all commits` is the safest flag to use, though it will not remove
much of the cache. Finally, when you delete what's in cache, it does not delete
the directory completely. It leaves the directory empty in your repo. To find
info and comment on this known issue, head to
[Issue #3375 here.](https://github.com/iterative/dvc/issues/3375) Your input is
ALWAYS valuable to us! üôèüèº

### [If I have two cloud folder links added to the DVC config, I'm able to push the data to the default one. How could I push the data to the other cloud folder?](https://discord.com/channels/485586884165107732/563406153334128681/833176227762274364)

You're looking for the `-r / --remote` option for `dvc push`. The command looks
like this:

```
dvc push --remote name_of_remote_storage
```

This will upload tracked files or directories to remote storage based on the
current _dvc.yaml_ and _.dvc_ files.

### [What's the current recommended way to automate hyperparameter search when using DVC pipelines?](https://discord.com/channels/485586884165107732/563406153334128681/829803720190590986)

Take a look at the new
[experiments feature](https://dvc.org/doc/start/experiments)! It enables you to
easily experiment with different parameter values.

You could script a grid search pretty easily by queueing an experiment for each
set of parameter values you want to try. For example,
`dvc exp run --queue -S alpha={alpha},beta={beta}`, and then compare the results
with `dvc exp show`.

We are working on developing experiments to have features or documented patterns
explicitly for grid search support, so definitely share any feedback to help
drive the future direction of that!

### [How can I pass sensitive strings (connectionString, containerName, etc) to DVC get without storing them to Git?](https://discord.com/channels/485586884165107732/563406153334128681/830021022337073185)

There's a bit of context behind this question that might give it more meaning.

---

I set up a private GitHub repo to be a data registry and I have set up a private
Azure remote where I have pushed some datasets.

At the moment I set up the Azure remote using the environment variables
[as the docs explain here](https://dvc.org/doc/command-reference/remote/add) so
I don't push sensitive information.

I am now trying to read those datasets from another repository
("my-project-repo"), using `dvc get` (e.g.
`dvc get git@github.com:data-registry-repo.git path/data.csv`) but I get this
error:

```bash
ERROR: failed to get 'path/data.csv' from 'git@github.com:data-registry-repo.git' - Authentication to Azure Blob Storage via default credentials (https://azuresdkdocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/python/azure-identity/1.4.0/azure.identity.html#azure.identity.DefaultAzureCredential) failed.
Learn more about configuration settings at <https://man.dvc.org/remote/modify>: unable to connect to account for Must provide either a connection_string or account_name with credentials!!
```

---

Generally, there are two ways solve this issue:

- ENV vars
- setup some options in the `--global, --system` DVC config

Once they removed some old remotes (with the same name) from their project repo
and tried to pull from the data registry using `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`
and `AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER_NAME`, it worked!

### [Is there any way to ensure that `dvc import` uses the cache from the config file?](https://discord.com/channels/485586884165107732/563406153334128681/827574712825413672)

This is another great question where a little context might be useful.

---

I'm trying to import a dataset project into another DVC project, let's call it
_dvcdata_.

The config for _dvcdata_ is:

```bash
[core]
    remote = awsremote
[cache]
    type = symlink
    dir = /home/user/dvc_cache
['remote "awsremote"']
    url = s3://...
```

When I run `dvc import git@github.com:user/dvcdata.git my_data`, it starts to
redownload it. I have double checked that I have pushed this config file to
master.

I have also checked that if I manually clone the repo and run
`cd /tmp/dvcdata; dvc pull`, the files are symlinked.

The command output says it's downloading to
`../../../../../../../tmp/tmphlgqpv9zdvc-clone/<file name>` so the cache isn't
being updated.

---

The repo you are importing into has its own cache directory.

If you want to use the same cache directory across both projects, you have to
configure `cache.dir` and link type in both projects.

## CML

[I have an ML model that retrains every 24 hours with updated data, but I do not want to create a merge request every time. I just need a nice way to look at the results. Is there a solution on how to report the results of a pipeline in Gitlab?](<[https://discord.com/channels/485586884165107732/728693131557732403/827099289372983336](https://discord.com/channels/485586884165107732/728693131557732403/827099289372983336)>)

Great question! CML doesn't currently have a feature that takes care of this,
but here are a couple of solutions (only one is needed):

1. Keep a separate branch with unrelated history for committing the reports.
2. Keep a single report file on the repository and update it with each commit.

[I've run into an error trying to get CML to orchestrate runs in my AWS account. It doesn't seem to be a permissions issue as the AWSEc2FullAccess policy seems to have worked, but I can't see the security group. What could be going wrong?](<[https://discord.com/channels/485586884165107732/728693131557732403/818450988084101160](https://discord.com/channels/485586884165107732/728693131557732403/818450988084101160)>)

Check to make sure you are deploying to the correct region. Use the argument
`--cloud-region <region>` (`us-west` for example) to mark the region where the
instance is deployed.

[Head to these docs]([https://discord.com/channels/485586884165107732/728693131557732403/818450988084101160)
for more information on the optional arguments that the CML runner accepts.

Until next month...
