# Production Environments

DVC brings best practices from software engineering into the development of data
science. This includes versioning, packaging, collaboration, among others. From
there it builds advanced features to aid in data engineering and machine
learning modeling, like reproducible data pipelines, experiment management, etc.

CML goes a step further, enabling seamless continuous integration and deployment
of your ML models.

But what happens once your project reaches production?

- Synchronizing pipeline state among environments
- Automated training, continuous learning
- Batch scoring (ETL)
- Real-time or on-demand predictions (API)
