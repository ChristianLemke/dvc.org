### [Q: Is it possible to plot metrics from multiple experiments together?>](https://discord.com/channels/485586884165107732/563406153334128681/834387923482181653)

You should be able to use experiment names in the `dvc plots` commands. You need
to use the `diff` flag to compare multiple plots. Try
`dvc plots diff exp-6ef18 exp-b17b4 exp-26e88`.

Thanks to @PythonF from Discord for asking this question that led to this Gem!

### [Q: Where are the configs for an experiment being push in Git when I run `dvc exp push`?](https://discord.com/channels/485586884165107732/563406153334128681/837773937390649364)

It uses custom Git refs internally, similar to the way GitHub handles PRs. You
can read more about how we handle our custom Git refs in
[this blog post](https://dvc.org/blog/experiment-refs).

Thanks to @Chandana for asking this question about experiments!

### [Q: Is there a way to list all the experiments I have on my DVC remote that have not been committed to Git?](https://discord.com/channels/485586884165107732/563406153334128681/836705209039978538)

Yes! The command `dvc exp list gitremote --all` lists all of the experiments for
the default remote in the Git repo.

Thanks again @Chandana for this gem!

### [Q: Is CML compatible with Azure DevOps?](https://discord.com/channels/485586884165107732/728693131557732403/841664412221177926)

Another great question from @Chandana!

Right now, we support GitHub and GitLab. Azure DevOps and GCP (Google Cloud
Platform) support are in the pipeline. Stay tuned for more updates!

### [Q: I pushed a lot of files using `dvc push` to my DVC remote, but there are a few that couldn't be pushed at the time. If I run `dvc push` again, will it just upload the missing files?]()

Thanks for the question @petek!

Yes! You can just re-run `dvc push` and it will only upload the missing files.

It might be a little slow than you would expect because DVC has to do some
checks to make sure that the other files were uploaded successfully before, but
as far as the actual data transfer goes, only the missing files will be
uploaded.
